# FIX
- using select .osr button multiple times will overwrite/replace instead of adding to queue when there's no beatmap being converted(works if something is being converted)
# DO 
- Add a blank screen first, then load real window after. Because user might think it's not loading.
- Pls try to reduce startup time good luck
- Skin drop down last item should be "Browse other skin", then it pops up a file dialog to choose a skin. In case the user has a skin not in osu folder.
- add tooltip for each setting for more information of that setting
